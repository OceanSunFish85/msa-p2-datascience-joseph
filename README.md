## MSA Phase2 Data Science Submission

This warehousing was used to submit content for the Data Science branch of MSA Phase 2, including analyzing and pre-processing data, training and evaluating a model to predict sales, and a convolutional neural network for visual classification.

Each folder contains the data, models, Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`), and Python code that needs to be submitted for that section.

For the deep learning part of it, I would recommend running the `.py` file in it as it always took me too long to train the model using Jupyter notebooks.
